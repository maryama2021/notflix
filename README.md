# Project title

### NotFlix

** Version 1.0 **

##  About / Synopsis

Project status: working/prototype.

NotFlix - cloud based video streaming service. NotFLIX is created to be an open source solution for streaming live video, right into the web browser using the HTML5 video tag.

The current version is a working prototype, which showcases the main ideas. The main design goal is low resource usage, build a proof-of-concept cloud application and NotFlix would gain insights into how their users are interacting with content e.g pause, play, stop etc. Additionally, the analytics team can extract data into their analytic platform using a secure connection. 

The proof-of-concept demonstrates the functionality of the tiers and inlcudes a minimum load balancing to handle web traffic, showcases high availability, and automated shaping of the service component.
